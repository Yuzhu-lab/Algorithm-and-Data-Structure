A list is an ordered collection of objects, the objects can be of different types
a = [21.42, 'foobar', 3, 4, 'bark', False, 3.14159]

import numpy as np
li = [1,2,3,4,5] * 2
np.array(li) * 2
li * n 会把原来的list append为 n 倍长
np.array(li) 让每一个元素乘以n

There is wrong data in ret ts, how to varify the data?
1. Cross validation from multiple vandors
2. today's return compare with previous 10-day moving average

List & Tuple
Tuple is immutable, list is mutable
Hashmap key has to be immutable because we need to calculate the hash value for it. 

np array is way faster because of the homogenous data type. In list, it could be different types.
