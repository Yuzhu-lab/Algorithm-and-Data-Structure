Idea:
The goal is to do the transformation until not need to. Thus we just need to compare the result of Comparison each round compared with the version before each comparison.
We just need to make a shallow copy of each round and save it at another address

Code:
def assemble(li):
    if len(li) <= 2:
        return 0
    while True:
        copy = li[::]
        while curr < len(li)-1:
            if li[curr] > li[curr-1] & li[curr] > li[curr+1]:
                li[curr] -= 1
            elif (li[curr] < li[curr-1]) & (li[right] < li[curr+1]):
                li[curr] -= 1
            curr += 1
        if copy == li:
            break
    return li
