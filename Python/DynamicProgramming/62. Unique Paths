# This is a DP problem, the 1st thing is to find what is the mathmatical formula
# Secondly, we need to find what is the case0. It should be all cases at the coner and upper and left side.

class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        D = {(1,1):0, (1,2):1, (2,1):1}
        for i in range(0, max(m,n)+1):
            D[(1,i)] = 1
            D[(i,1)] = 1
        for i in range(2,m+1):
            for j in range(2,n+1):
                D[(i,j)] = D[(i-1,j)] + D[(i,j-1)]
        return D[(m,n)]
