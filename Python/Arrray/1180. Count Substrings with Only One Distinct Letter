Idea:
To calculate how many same letter substring there is,
the 1st thing is chop up the original string and then for each substring, we calculate how many small ones there
eg: zzz 1+2+3
Thus we could add them up as we found more z in this process.

Code:
def co(string):
    if len(string) == 1:
        return 1
    samecha = 1
    res = 1
    for i in range(0,len(string)-1):
        if string[i] == string[i+1]:
            samecha += 1
        res += samecha
    return res
