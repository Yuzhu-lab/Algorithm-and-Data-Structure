For linked list, I need 3 variables to call so I use a = b = c at the 1st line
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        car1 = car2 = head
        for i in range(0, n):
            car1 = car1.next
        if not car1:
            return head.next
        while car1.next:
            car1 = car1.next
            car2 = car2.next
        car2.next = car2.next.next
        return head
